###########################################
### THE MEANING OF NUMBERS ON A BIRTH CHART ###
###########################################

### NUMBER 1: EGO & SELF-EXPRESSION
**Location:** Entrance to the Physical Plane.
**Represents:** The ego and how it is expressed or suppressed. Indicates the degree of personal self-control and reaction to people and circumstances.

#### ONE 1
People with a single 1 have some difficulty in verbally expressing their inner feelings. They can be forceful orators on impersonal subjects but fall short when explaining personal attitudes. They may say the opposite of what they mean as a defense mechanism, which can lead to arguments. They must learn to think before they speak.

#### TWO 1's
Blessed with balanced self-expression. They can often see both sides of a situation or argument, making for a broad understanding of people. This is a valuable characteristic.

#### THREE 1's
Two types exist. The most common is the talkative, bright, interesting chatterbox who enjoys life. The minority group, often with no numbers on the Soul Plane, are quieter and more introspective, but become talkative in friendly company. They often express themselves better through writing.

#### FOUR 1's
Experience difficulty with verbal expression and are often misunderstood. They learn to hide emotional turmoil with a smile and tend to suffer inwardly. It's important for them to learn to command their emotions and express rather than suppress their inner feelings.

#### FIVE OR MORE 1's
With five, six, or seven 1's, ego suppression is created to counteract difficulty with verbal expression. They can be sad and misunderstood, creating aloofness and loneliness. They can become somewhat obsessive about their appearance. They benefit from involvement in art forms like writing, painting, or music.

### NUMBER 2: INTUITION & SENSITIVITY
**Location:** Gateway of the Soul Plane.
**Represents:** The key to intuition, sensitivity, and feeling. A person without a 2 is not devoid of these traits but needs to consciously develop them. Women possess a "de facto" 2 due to their nature.

#### ONE 2
Indicates a sound, basic level of intuition. For women, a single 2 on their chart gives them the equivalent of the balanced double 2. For men, a single 2 is a great starting point, but they must diligently practice developing balanced sensitivity. These individuals need time to relax and spend time in nature.

#### TWO 2's
This is the ideal balance for the easy development of intuitive sensitivity. These people possess an innate perception and an intelligence above average, with an acute ability to understand people and circumstances. Their first impressions are amazingly reliable and accurate.

#### THREE 2's
Indicates an unbalanced hypersensitivity. This person is highly attuned to the feelings of others and can get deeply involved in other people's problems. As a form of self-protection, they may spend much time in a world of their own feelings, exhibiting an aloofness that leads to loneliness.

#### FOUR 2's
This high level of impressionability must be carefully disciplined, or it can erupt into severe misrepresentations, bad temper, sarcasm, and spite. These people are often extremely impatient and their intuition becomes unreliable. They can overreact and become emotionally volatile.

#### FIVE 2's
An extremely rare occurrence. Individuals with five 2's are very likely to become totally reactive to their enormous sensitivity. They need extremely concentrated and devoted care and guidance, especially when very young.

### NUMBER 3: MEMORY & THE MIND
**Location:** Gateway to the Mind Plane.
**Represents:** Governs memory. A single 3 is the most desirable strength. Absence of a 3 indicates a need to exert greater effort in mental spheres and to combat a tendency toward laziness.

#### ONE 3
Provides a natural quality of memory that supports the person throughout life. It makes it easy to maintain alert mental activity and assists with education. They generally have happy dispositions and above-average self-confidence.

#### TWO 3's
Comes with increased mental alertness, a pronounced imagination, and increased literary ability. This power needs to be carefully disciplined to avoid losing track of reality. Most people with two 3's have significant writing ability and should be encouraged to set their thoughts on paper.

#### THREE 3's
With greater emphasis on mental activity, these people can lose contact with reality, leading to isolation and loneliness. Their fertile imagination is so intent on thinking ahead that they find it difficult to focus on the present. They find trust difficult and are rarely relaxed.

#### FOUR 3's
An unusual amount of 3's. The excessive imagination and mental hyperactivity can bring them to the point of intense fear, worry, and confusion. They have an impractical outlook on life and need encouragement in practical, "doing" activities.

### NUMBER 4: ORDER & PRACTICALITY
**Location:** Center of the Physical Plane.
**Represents:** A practical and material number. People with this number are generally tidy, meticulous, practical, and organised. Birth charts without a 4 indicate a degree of impatience.

#### ONE 4
These are active people with a natural identity with the practical, including organisational, technical, financial, and physical involvements. They prefer practice to principles and can be dogmatic. Too much emphasis on the physical can make them materialistic.

#### TWO 4's
Can lead to an unbalanced outlook that relates everything to the physical and material. These people must seek balanced expression between the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of their life. They require more sensitivity from friends and colleagues.

#### THREE 4's
The aspects of the double 4 are intensified. They experience even greater difficulty rising above the physical and are often drawn back by materialism. They can have a tendency toward weak lower limbs (knees, ankles, feet).

#### FOUR 4's
An extremely rare occurrence. Due to the extreme pull of the physical, great care in all activities must be taken. There often exists a critical weakness in their lower limbs, which can result in crippling.

### NUMBER 5: LOVE & FREEDOM
**Location:** Center of the Birth Chart and Soul Plane.
**Represents:** Governs the intensity of human feelings, love, and freedom of expression. Its influence enhances all other numbers. It helps in achieving emotional control.

#### ONE 5
Provides the best chance of achieving a balanced personality. It assists in achieving emotional control and ensures sensitivity develops into a reliable intuitive guide. It strengthens fortitude and compassion, creating strength of character.

#### TWO 5's
Frequently recognized for their driving intensity, determination, and air of great confidence. Their enthusiasm can be overbearing. They are prone to emotional turmoil and can develop digestive issues or ulcers in the region of the solar plexus. They must exercise emotional control.

#### THREE 5's
The intensity of the double 5 is even more pronounced. This emotional intensity can be very difficult to handle. Very special and careful training in self-discipline is a vital part of their early lives.

#### FOUR 5's
A rare occurrence. The overwhelming intensity of feeling can be almost life-threatening. They are highly accident-prone and generally in a state of advanced stress. Life can be very difficult if they do not permit wise guidance.

### NUMBER 6: CREATIVITY & HOME
**Location:** Center of the Mind Plane.
**Represents:** Human creativity and its opposite, destruction (worry, stress). A single 6 without other numbers on the chart requires conscious development of creative faculties.

#### ONE 6
The most common expression is a deep love of the home and strong focus on domestic responsibility. To achieve full life satisfaction, they often need to exert their will to bring more personal creative expression (like arts and music) into their lives beyond just the home.

#### TWO 6's
Can be either a challenge or a handicap. Negatively, it produces worry, anxiety, and stress, particularly around the home. This is counteracted by directing interests beyond the home into personally creative pursuits. These people require more rest than most.

#### THREE 6's
Comes with greater worry concerning the home, often of the individual's own making. Women with this can become fanatically protective and possessively loving. They may not realize its positive potential for brilliant creativity, instead turning it inward as disturbed emotions.

#### FOUR 4's
Indicates exceptional creative potential, but the negative aspect (worry) is ever-ready to dominate. They can become pathetic worriers. This can be countered if parents recognize this tendency early and guide the child's creative potential with love.

### NUMBER 7: LEARNING & SACRIFICE
**Location:** Highest number of the Physical Plane.
**Represents:** The amount of learning one must amass, generally through the unforgettable personal experience called sacrifice. This can be in matters of health, love, or money. It is the number of philosophic understanding. Lack of a 7 implies this has been learned in past lives or needs to be learned now.

#### ONE 7
Sacrifices in health, love, or money will be encountered as part of the soul's unfolding. Loss in these areas is intended to strengthen and purify habits and attitudes. It teaches the difference between "preference" and "obsession."

#### TWO 7's
Implies a greater intensity of the lessons to be undertaken, often through loss in two of the three basic areas (health, love, money). The experience is intended to focus the individual on a deeper philosophical understanding of life and interest in the metaphysical.

#### THREE 7's
Appears to result in particularly sad lives brought about by heavy loss in all three areas. However, the sadness is often more unsettling to others than to the sufferer, who, with a deep philosophical understanding, often recognizes the purpose behind the events. Such loss can endow them with enormous strength of character.

#### FOUR 7's
Exceedingly careful help is necessary, else all will feel the burden of such compounded sacrifice. It provides wonderful potential for rapid growth in spiritual consciousness if the person has the essential personal discipline to gain "empire over the self."

### NUMBER 8: WISDOM & INDEPENDENCE
**Location:** Most active number of the Soul Plane.
**Represents:** Dually represents wisdom (spiritually) and active independence (physically). Absence of an 8 indicates that one must deliberately apply themselves to achieve wisdom and independence.

#### ONE 8
These people are most methodical and meticulous when living positively. They have a natural tidiness and feel for efficiency. Negatively, they can be emotionally unstable, reactive, and restless, resulting in frequent changes in home, career, or relationships.

#### TWO 8's
The sharpened power of assessment can be extremely beneficial or highly unsettling. They can excel in matters demanding special care to detail, but must be careful not to become dictatorial. Their search for truth can stimulate a positive restlessness, inspiring travel.

#### THREE 8's
Acute restlessness and pessimism can manifest when living negatively. For the positive person with three 8's, great wisdom and a glorious feeling of independence underpins their daily living with inner stability and joyousness.

#### FOUR 8's
These are extremely hyperactive, restless people. As children, they should never be forced to sit still, as it leads to frustration and irrational behavior. They should be taught to develop a sound sense of direction and be taken places often.

### NUMBER 9: AMBITION & IDEALISM
**Location:** The action end of the Mind Plane.
**Represents:** A powerful number representing the right-lobe of the brain and its power of idealism. Its physical counterpart is ambition. It is a three-fold number of Ambition, Responsibility, and Idealism.

#### ONE 9
The most beneficial application of one 9 is to express it through a balance of its three aspects: ambition, responsibility, and idealism. Too much focus on ambition without the other two can lead to negative outcomes. The practice of moderation is vital.

#### TWO 9's
Characterized by an intensity of idealism and zeal, coupled with serious thought. They can express an overzealous idealism that becomes impractical. They must maintain a sound level of practicality and guard against being critical of others with less intensity.

#### THREE 9's
The exceptional power is difficult to handle and can produce mental imbalance. It's important for these people to balance their expression more evenly over all three Planes. They can exaggerate small things, leading to outbursts of temper and loss of emotional control.

#### FOUR 9's
Two distinct types. The most common lives in a dream world of vague unreality, often dropping out of society due to fanatical idealism. The other type is aggressive and belligerent, taking pleasure in belittling others who fall short of their ideals. These can be the dangerous ones.

#### FIVE 9's
Everything written about four 9's applies here with compounded significance. Teaching them to be practical and compassionate is the greatest challenge.

### ISOLATED NUMBERS
Occurs when one or more of the corner numbers (1, 3, 7, 9) are unconnected to any other number in the chart.

#### ISOLATED 1
**Problem:** When 2, 5, and 4 are missing. These people feel isolated and misunderstood when trying to explain their feelings. It can lead to them being perceived as lazy or unreliable, magnifying into loneliness.
**Correction:** The primary correction is to develop the quality of the number 5: more love, compassion, and free emotional expression. Developing the qualities of 2 (intuition) and 4 (practicality) also helps integrate the 1.

#### ISOLATED 3
**Problem:** When 2, 5, and 6 are missing. The person's strong mind potential can be easily diffused as it's not connected to practical action. If more than one 3 is isolated, imagination can run riot, leading to paranoia.
**Correction:** Develop the power of 5 (love/compassion), then 2 (intuition) to link logic to the ego, and then 6 (creativity) to link the 3 to the 9, creating the Arrow of the Intellect.

#### ISOLATED 7
**Problem:** When 4, 5, and 8 are missing. The lessons of sacrifice learned through the 7 have to be repeated because the learning experience is not translated to the mind. This implies repeated loss in health, love, or money until the lesson is understood.
**Correction:** Develop the qualities of 4 (to unify the 7 with the ego of 1), 5 (love/compassion), and 8 (wisdom through loving action) to build the Arrow of Activity and connect the learning to the Soul plane.

#### ISOLATED 9
**Problem:** When 5, 6, and 8 are missing. The individual exhibits impractical idealism, unrequited ambition, or both. A single 9 points to unfulfilled ambition; a double 9 to impractical idealism.
**Correction:** Inculcate the qualities of 5 (the most important), then 6 and 8. The 5 will link the 9 to the ego expression of 1. If a 7 is also present, develop both 5 and 8 for optimum connection.

###############################
### THE ARROWS OF INDIVIDUALITY ###
###############################

### ARROW OF DETERMINATION (Strength: 1-5-9)
**Meaning:** Determination underlies almost everything these people undertake. It is coupled with persistence, which can sometimes turn into dogged stubbornness. The decisiveness can be a fine quality, but they must learn to use it wisely and not be motivated by stubbornness.
**For Children:** They express very decided tastes from infancy. They need space to express their determination but with appropriate training in understanding and moderation. They should be led with loving kindness.

### ARROW OF PROCRASTINATION (Weakness: Missing 1-5-9)
**Meaning:** This effectively divides the Birth Chart, separating the intuitive analytical components from the practical, leading to procrastination. If allowed to perpetuate, it will be extremely counter-productive, inhibiting progress and causing frustration.
**For Children:** Parents should recognize this trait early and teach them the necessary patience and persistence to complete tasks.

### ARROW OF SPIRITUALITY (Strength: 3-5-7)
**Meaning:** Links the three most powerful numbers on each Plane, creating potential for deep spiritual awareness, which is the basis for a balanced practical philosophy on life. These people prefer to learn from personal experience rather than taking advice, which can bring sadness to their earlier lives but inspires them to develop fortitude and philosophic understanding. Their presence often brings peace.
**For Children:** They show an almost naive trust in people and a deep sense of natural justice. They should never be willfully deceived. They should be carefully guided in spiritual matters and encouraged to read well-chosen books.

### ARROW OF THE ENQUIRER / SCEPTICISM (Weakness: Missing 3-5-7)
**Meaning:** These people accept nothing based on trust and need to investigate for themselves. They display scepticism as initial negativity, but once they investigate and prove a concept for themselves, their scepticism turns to avid acceptance. The nature of these people is to investigate. Uncertainties about life can arise if too much scepticism dominates their thinking.
**For Children:** They often express their scepticism through moodiness. Parents should encourage them to read and investigate the reasons behind things, developing a healthy curiosity, and also to become active in an artistic pursuit.

### ARROW OF THE INTELLECT (Strength: 3-6-9)
**Meaning:** Indicates the dominance of mental activity and an extremely active brain. These people are usually bright, happy, and alert, preferring things intellectual rather than aesthetic. They must avoid developing intellectual snobbishness. They handle responsibilities well but need to watch the tendency to drive their brains too much without adequate rest.
**For Children:** They frequently feature among the top of their classes, especially in math and science. They are inclined to be restive and headstrong when not sufficiently inspired. They respond well to praise. Care should be taken with their diets to avoid stimulating foods.

### ARROW OF POOR MEMORY (Weakness: Missing 3-6-9)
**Meaning:** The person has to work hard to keep their memory active. Once they become mentally lazy, their memory rapidly loses its keenness, which can lead to a depletion of mental acuity in mid-life. However, this handicap can be successfully overcome with diligence.
**For Children:** They will need special, patient training. They may appear intellectually slow. They should be trained to develop concentration. Academic training should not be forced and should start later.

### ARROW OF EMOTIONAL BALANCE (Strength: 2-5-8)
**Meaning:** These people possess a natural balance in their emotional life and a depth of spiritual understanding. They perceive life as a balanced union of the physical and spiritual. They can become excellent actors due to their powerful emotional control. Their balanced sensitivity helps them readily perceive other people's needs, giving them talents in counseling and healing.
**For Children:** Can be absorbed in their world of impressions and seen as dreamers. They are susceptible to emotional conflicts. They need balanced emotional training and should be shielded from noisy or emotionally stimulating media.

### ARROW OF HYPERSENSITIVITY (Weakness: Missing 2-5-8)
**Meaning:** Their soul protection is not strong, so their sensitivity is exposed. They are easily hurt, especially when young, and can become exceedingly shy or develop an inferiority complex. They have a deeply loving nature but can become reactive due to personal hurt. Emotional control is one of their most important life lessons.
**For Children:** Exceptionally shy and sensitive. Parents need to listen to their fears and anxieties. They crave love and appreciation. Never scold or criticize them in front of others.

### ARROW OF PRACTICALITY (Strength: 1-4-7)
**Meaning:** These are the doing people of the world, clever with their hands. Their heavy emphasis on the Physical Plane can make them poor judges of character. Care should be taken that they do not become too caught up in materialism.
**For Children:** Exhibit a strong desire for material things. The virtue of appreciation and sharing should be taught early. They are physically motivated and respond to kindness and appreciation, but forcing them can arouse resentment and obstinacy.

### ARROW OF DISORDER (Weakness: Missing 1-4-7)
**Meaning:** Without any numbers on the Physical Plane, these individuals can lapse into a life of theory. Without physical action, life becomes disordered and unfulfilled. Patient, practical experience is vital for them to "get their act together."
**For Children:** Need to be taught to be practical and tidy from a young age. They should be encouraged to do one thing at a time and finish it. Practical games and help around the house are beneficial.

### ARROW OF THE PLANNER (Strength: 1-2-3)
**Meaning:** Links the gateway numbers of each plane. They have an inherent love of order, method, and understanding. They prefer the function of organising over practical details. They need to guard against subtle laziness and pay more attention to small details.
**For Children:** Happiest when organizing their own plans. They can be detached, so loving but firm discipline is needed to teach cooperation and respect for others' ideas and possessions.

### ARROW OF THE WILL (Strength: 4-5-6)
**Meaning:** A powerful balance of the three center numbers of each Plane, symbolizing the human spine. People with this arrow can be very dynamic. The power lies in its integration and balance. When they recognize and apply this balance, their lives transform with success. They have great fortitude and courage.
**For Children:** Can be a handful. They are exceptionally strong-willed and must be trained to understand others' points of view and accept guidance. They respond well to loving praise but become suspicious of material tokens.

### ARROW OF FRUSTRATION (Weakness: Missing 4-5-6)
**Meaning:** Reveals a divided Birth Chart and often a weak will. Frustration for these people is unfulfilled expectation. They often expect more from others than they are prepared to give. Life may present losses and separations as vital steps in evolving.
**For Children:** Need a special depth of love and attention. They experience acute disappointments. Parents must teach them to "prefer" rather than "expect," so they are not emotionally hooked to outcomes.

### ARROW OF ACTIVITY (Strength: 7-8-9)
**Meaning:** Links the numbers of experience, wisdom, and ambition/responsibility. The forcefulness of this combination can be taken overboard into hyperactivity. They can become agitated by suppressed nervous energy. Peace, harmony, and time in nature are necessary for them.
**For Children:** Especially susceptible to high levels of noise, demanding peace and harmony. They need the freedom of the outdoors. They should be protected from noisy or violent media.

### ARROW OF PASSIVITY (Weakness: Missing 7-8-9)
**Meaning:** These people will be the thinkers, planners, and behind-the-scenes guides, but not the achievers unless they undergo intense training in perseverance. The negative aspect is laziness and inertness. They need to be taught to be more physically active.
**For Children:** Will need to be encouraged toward greater physical involvement. This is best done by example and loving encouragement to participate in sports and outdoor activities.

###################################
### BIRTH CHARTS WITH NO ARROWS ###
###################################
**Meaning:** Indicates that the person needs to devote more time and perseverance to the development of their strengths. They are generally quite adaptable people. The primary lesson they need to develop is wise assertiveness.
**For Children:** Easygoing and generally quite happy. They should be encouraged with loving care to do things they enjoy to help them become more assertive.
